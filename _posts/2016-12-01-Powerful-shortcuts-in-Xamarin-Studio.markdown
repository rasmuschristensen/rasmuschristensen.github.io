<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">X</span>amarin Studio is a great IDE for working with Xamarin technologies. With a Windows and Visual Studio background the IDE can be a bit confusing regarding shortcuts. Here are some of the shortcuts I find very useful. 
</p>

## Toggle between XAML & code behiend
When using Xamarin Forms, you often work in a XAML file and from time to time need to navigate to its code behiend C# file or vice versa.

__CTRL + CMD + Arrow Up__

## Easy openfile & window navigation
When you open the openfile/window dialog in Xamarin Studio __ALT + TAB__ its by default not easy to use the arrow keys to jump between the files. 

If you release the TAB key and press

__CTRL + TAB -> CTRL + CMD + Arrow key(s)__

you can now jump easily between the files in the dialog 

I'll keep this post updated when I find new shortcuts.
